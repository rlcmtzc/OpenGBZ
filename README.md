# OpenGBZ
This is an **OpenSource Gameboy Zero PCB Project**. It is intended to make your own custom Button PCB and change the design to your wishes.  
Your welcome to download the PCB files and use it for your own project. If you change anything on the design it would be great if you  
push your changes here so the project can grow and we can get some nice different designs and ideas. Feel also free to push other gameboyzero related PCBs if you want to share them. 

Please also add your changes to the [forum](https://www.sudomod.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=6499) post so everybody can easily see the changes and features of the different designs. I will also add the different designes here in the Readme file (Can´t update all the time and immediately so in the forum should be the newest versions and of course in the different directories)  

## How to add your Design and what is needed:
In the different directories you find the different PCBs. If you want to push a design please add a new directory with a name for your designe and in there add a README.md where you can shortly describe the features of your PCB.  

This readme should at least include (See OSDMG0v1 and OSDMG0v2 as a template) :
* **Your name** (and on which board its based of)
* If you tested the Board and if it works
* if you have also a BOM-file for the needed components
* if used in a Build you can link the Build
* A description of the Features of the Board (also some Pictures would be nice)
* Additional Info to the Board if needed. (For example a tutorial how to use specific non self-describing parts pf the boards or also provide software if needed)
* Short description on how to use the board and a list of parts needed for the Board (if not included in the BOM file)  

In the same directory as the readme you should add the .sch and .brd files and gerbers. (You can also link to your project if it was created with an online editor just make sure everybody can get the files)  

You can also add your current work in progress files and ask others for ideas or feedback. If so mark your post as work in progress.  

## Overview of currently added projects:
Here is a short overview of the currently added projets to this repository pleas keep in mind that this part is not necessary up to date pleas look in the forum post or in the different directories for the newest designs.  

| Directory Name       | Author Name           | Tested     | BOM-file | progress          |
| :-------------------:|:---------------------:| :---------:| :-------: | :----------------:|

## Terms of use
* **You can do everything with the files the only thing I would appreciate is not to use the designs and sell the PCBs this should stay a non-profit project.**
* **Please add the logo found in this directory and add it to your PCB so everybody can determ that this is part of this project**
* **If your design bases of another designe please reference the author**
* **Be sure your files are availible and the readme is present**  

This Project should be for makers who want to create their own projects or just to test something new and this should be a help to getting started. If I see that the terms of use won´t be followed (especially the selling of boards) I´m forced to take down the project or to find another (not that open and easy) way to share the project.
